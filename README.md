A repo for my presentation from Barcamp Bangalore XII.

The files in this repo are the WIP and final decks that I used. I actually used both v3.0 and v2.0 in the live talk and retroactively added in the content into v3.0. You can still see the live version if you click on the link in Slide #40.

The bulk of the deck talks about GUTSE - a theory of software engineering arrived at by two Swedish professors that I found on the net.

My own theory - GUTS - can be found in a repo with that name here on Github as a mindmap.

I've gotten feedback that I should evolve GUTS to something concrete. I intend to.

I used PPT this time (instead of Impress) not because I didnt want to, but because non-linear presentation requires much more thought put into mapping out the "space" that you'd like to explore in the presentation. I just didnt have the time this time around.
